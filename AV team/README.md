### Project Title:
ROCK , PAPER , SCISSORS

### Description:

"Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a simple hand game that is often used to make a decision between two people. In the game, each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are "rock," "paper," and "scissors." The rules are as follows:

Rock beats scissors (Rock wins)
Scissors beats paper (Scissors win)
Paper beats rock (Paper wins)

If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie, and it is usually played again

Here's how you can play Rock, Paper, Scissors:

Step 1: Choose Your Weapon

You and your opponent decide which of the three options you want to represent: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

Step 2: Count Down and Show Your Choice

You and your opponent count down together, for example, by saying "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!" or any similar phrase.
On "Shoot," both of you simultaneously form one of the three shapes with an outstretched hand. Make sure to keep your choice hidden until the count is over.

Step 3: Determine the Winner

Compare the choices:
If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie, and you might play again.
If one player's choice beats the other's based on the rules, that player is the winner.
For example, if one player shows Rock and the other shows Scissors, Rock wins.

Step 4: Play Again (if desired)
