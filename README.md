[JavaScript, CSS, and HTML were utilised in the process.]

### How to Use It:
[In the game, the player earns points by maneuvering the snake to eat pieces of food that appear at random locations on the screen. The snake has to be moved using arrows. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer and moves faster, making the game progressively more difficult.The game ends when the snake either moves into the screenâ€™s border or moves into itself.The objective of the game is to eat as much food as possible before the game ends.]
